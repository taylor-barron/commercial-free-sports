                        Hi, I'm Taylor ðŸ‘‹. I have always loved college football and weekends. In fact, I have always tried to maximize 
                        both. No Commercials Pro was built to show you the most enjoyable games to watch to maximize your football viewing 
                        experience and your weekend. By avoiding social media and tv screens through Saturday afternoon one is able to 
                        achieve both an excellent Saturday AND watch several awesome games in just a few hours. This website is dedicated to 
                        helping others make that happen.

                        Skip Commercials Pro uses an alogrithm that is able to rate the awesomeness of a football game and rank them per TV 
                        time slot WITHOUT spoiling anything about the game. What does that mean for you? It means that you can do whatever you love 
                        the morning and afternoon Saturday and then watch the four best games of the day back to back without sitting through a single 
                        commercial break. Oh, you're sick of the Burger King commercial? I haven't seen it. And I won't.

                        By the way if you can't/don't want to live the commercial free lifestyle for whatever reason and just want to see the algorithmetically 
                        selected best games of the week you're also covered. Here's one more list to look through during the week.

                        How It Works
                    </div>

                    <div className="p-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
                        Game ratings are calculated in several parts. The first and maybe most important is generated by calculating how much of 
                        the game was close OR by whether the team that was losing was able to make a comeback. This is modified with a bonus if 
                        the game was closer than the spread.
                    </div>

                    <div className="p-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
                        The second part is the importance of the game. This is generated very simply, currently. If the team has played less than 
                        ten games then this score factors in historical record. The historical record accounts for the percentage of games less than 
                        ten. (EX: For a team that has played five games historical record factors in 50%.) If the team has played ten games then the 
                        importance for each team is the win/loss percentage. These are added together and divided by two (There's two teams).

                    <div className="p-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
                        The third rating is the explosiveness rating. Great games have big plays and this rating is created by 
                        iterating through each play of the game and adding to an explosiveness score when chunk plays, scores, 
                        turnovers, sacks and other big plays happen.
                    </div>

                    <div className="p-6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">
                        The fourth rating is the talent composite score of the two teams. All things being equal, great athletes usually 
                        make great games. The more talent on the field, the better. This rating is pulled from College Football API that tracks overall 
                        team talent and not modified very much.

                        The final and least important rating is for how many penalties occur in the game. This should be weighted the least heavily 
                        but if I have to choose between no penalties and lots of penalties the choice is pretty easy.

                        These ratings are weighted and added together to form a total composite ranking which is displayed in ranked order within the 
                        web application. If you make a profile you can weight the scores however you want.
